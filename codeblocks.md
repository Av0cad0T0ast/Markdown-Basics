# Code Blocks and Syntax Highlighting

In Markdown, you can present code in two different ways: inline code and code blocks.

---

**Inline Code**

To format a small piece of code within your text, enclose it in single backticks (\`):

`Inline Code`

---

**Code Blocks**

For larger code snippets or multiple lines, use triple backticks (\```), followed by the language identifier (optional) and the code and add another tripple backticks at the end to close the code. For example, in Python:

```python
def example_function():
    print("Hello, Markdown!")
```
This creates a visually separated and sytnax-highlighted code block.
