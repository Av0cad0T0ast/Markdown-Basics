# Links and Images

In Markdown, you can easily add links to your documents. The basic syntax for a link is using square brackets for the link text followed by parentheses for the URL. For example:

[Google](https://www.google.com)

This creates a clickable link with the text "Google" that directs users to (https://www.google.com).

Markdown also allows you to embed images. To include an image, use an exclamation mark (!) followed by square brackets for alt text and parentheses for the image URL. For instance:

![Alt Text](https://github.com/Av0cad0T0ast/Markdown-Basics/assets/112451921/229eae8b-57a2-48f3-a355-25e0dae86d5a)

This inserts an image from the provided URL.
