# Basic Syntax: Headers, Lists, and Paragraphs
---
## __Headers__

Headers in Markdown are created by using pound signs (#). The number of pound signs correlates with the header size. For example, Header 1 has one # sign followed by a space:

# Header 1

Header 2, on the other hand, is created with two consecutive pound signs (##) followed by a space:

## Header 2
---
## __Lists__

Lists in Markdown can be either unordered or ordered. For unordered lists, use a hyphen (-) followed by a space before each item:

- Unordered List Item 1
- Unordered List Item 2

Ordered lists are created using numbers and a period before each item:

1. Ordered List Item 1
2. Ordered List Item 2

## __Paragraphs and Text Formatting__

# Formatting Text

In Markdown, you have several options to format text and add emphasis to your writing.

To make text bold, use two asterisks (**) or underscores (__):

**Bold Text**

(**Bold Text**)

---

For italic text, use a single asterisk (*) or underscore (_):

*Italic Text*

(*Italic Text*)

---

To format text as inline code, enclose it in backticks (\`):

`Inline Code`

(`Inline Code`)

---

To strike through text, use two tilde symbols (~~):

~~Strikethrough Text~~

(~~Strikethrough Text~~)
