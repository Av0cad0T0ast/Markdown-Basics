# Basic Syntax: Headers, Lists, and Paragraphs

## __Headers__

Headers in Markdown are created by using pound signs (#). The number of pound signs correlates with the header size. For example, Header 1 has one # sign followed by a space:

# Header 1

Header 2, on the other hand, is created with two consecutive pound signs (##) followed by a space:

## Header 2

## __Lists__

Lists in Markdown can be either unordered or ordered. For unordered lists, use a hyphen (-) followed by a space before each item:

- Unordered List Item 1
- Unordered List Item 2

Ordered lists are created using numbers and a period before each item:

1. Ordered List Item 1
2. Ordered List Item 2

## __Paragraphs__

Markdown allows you to add emphasis to text using various formatting options. Use a single asterisk (*) or underscore (_) for italic text:

*Italic* or _Italic_

For bold text, use two asterisks (**) or underscores (__):

**Bold** or __Bold__
